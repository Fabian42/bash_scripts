# bash_scripts
Contains various bash scripts that I have written mainly for myself.

Contents so far:
* `.bashrc`: Many console shortcuts. Some have grown a lot over time, especially `dl`. (TODO: explain some of the entries better)
* `resize.sh`: Shrinks a video below a given maximum size, while preserving as much quality as possible.
* `corona.sh`: Parses various sources and copies the resulting Corona vaccination and case numbers to clipboard for my spreadsheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDTghO_ZYBs5nfs2kDc0Ms6e9bbx7clx_QgkWii7OMY
